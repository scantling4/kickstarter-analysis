# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overwiew of Project

### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise, a girl who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign that will help to fund a play called Fever. She has access to a lot of data on previous Kickstarter campaigns and this analysis will allow her to see if there are specific factors that make a campaign successful or unsuccessful.  

## Analysis of Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Success Based on Launch Date](CrowdFundingAnalysis/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) This graph shows the success and failures of theater outcomes based on the month in which the campaign was launched. The most successful campaigns were launched in May so I would recommend that Louise take into account the month in which she is planning on launching her campaign. Additionally, she could do further analysis to see if there are specific days or weeks that are more optimal than others based on the data. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Comparison of Outcomes and Goals](CrowdFundingAnalysis/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) This graph shows the comparison of outcomes (success and failure) based on varying ranges of fundraising goals. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I had a lot of difficulty with a few different functions. For example, in the Deliverable 1, I struggled with changing the row labels to display the months of the year. I had issues with this earlier because I could not figure out how to use the Groupby function on the Mac. After combing through multiple resources and watching a few videos, I was able to figure it out an obtain the desired results. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Theater Kickstarter campaigns are most successful in the month of May. It is not recommended to start a campaign in December because it shows the lowest success rate out of the twelve months. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The outcomes based on goals show that there are certain monetary goal ranges that equate success while others will result in failure. Campaigns that have goals ranging from zero dollars to five thousand dollars are most likely to be successful. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There are a few limitations of this dataset. Although there is a lot of data in this dataset, not all of it is pertinent to Louiseâ€™s goal. For example, there is no way to determine if the parent category of publishing will be important to include in the analysis. There are several Kickstarter campaigns, but they may be drastically different from the theater campaigns that Louise will be interested in. The data also does not assess the methods that the campaigns utilized to optimize success. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Another table or chart we could create could look at the relationship between duration of campaign and outcome. Another table could compare the average donation and outcome and differing types of campaigns such as film and video versus music. Further analysis may need to be completed to address the impact of outliers in the calculation of averages.
